Weather App Description

Welcome to the Weather App, a powerful and user-friendly application designed to provide real-time weather updates.
Built with modern Android development practices, this app leverages the following technologies and architectural patterns:

Kotlin: The primary programming language used for the app.

Dagger Hilt: For dependency injection, ensuring a modular and testable codebase.

MVVM Pattern: Adopting the Model-View-ViewModel architecture for a clear separation of concerns and easier maintenance.

Generic Adapter: To efficiently handle various data sets and views.

Retrofit: A type-safe HTTP client for making API requests.

OpenWeatherAPI: The source of our comprehensive weather data.

LiveData and MutableLiveData: For observable data holders, ensuring the UI updates reactively.

ViewModel: To manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.

Repository Pattern: To provide a clean API for data access.

Kotlin Coroutines: For asynchronous programming, making it easier to manage background threads.
